tt10241024,2 Weeks in Lagos,"Directed by Kathryn Fasegha. With Toyin Abraham, Bambo Adebowale, Lawal Aramide, Ayanlola Ayankunle. ""2 Weeks in Lagos"" is a turbulent and thrilling journey into the lives of Ejikeme and Lola. Their lives collide when Ejikeme an investment banker comes home from the United States with Lola's brother Charlie to invest in Nigerian businesses. It is love at first sight for them and as they embark on a journey of discovering this new love, they have to contend with the political ambitions of Ejikeme's mother who is planning a marriage between him and the only daughter of Otunba Ayodeji, a political juggernaut who is considering Ejikeme's father as his running mate for the Nigerian Presidency. His mother's actions create a rift between Ejikeme and Lola that pits their families against one another with almost deadly results. Ejike's mother is a driven social butterfly with just one aim in mind, make her husband President and become the First Lady. Lola's mother is a psychologist with a cool temperament but she is pushed too far when her daughter is threatened. As the love story of Ejikeme and Lola unfolds, viewers will laugh, cry and root for true love all at once.

In ""2 Weeks in Lagos"" we witness the impact of superstitions on the Nigerian mind when a father tries to kill his young daughter who he has accused of being a demon child (Ogbanje in the local parlance), claiming she is the reason for his depressed business and his wife's sickness that had been going on since she was born. When he is stopped from doing this by Lola and her tailor Madam Eloho, he dumps the child on Madam Eloho and leaves without a backward glance. In Madam Eloho, the elasticity of the Nigerian psyche in dealing with difficulties is fully displayed as she takes on the child without giving it any though and declares that ""God will help us"" when Lola questions her about being able to provide for the child.

""2 Weeks in Lagos"" captures the excitement and vibrancy of everyday life in Lagos and reflects the complexity of life in Lagos, a dynamic city where anything is possible in 2 Weeks. Through out the story, Nigerian traditions are explored in an authentic manner that is exciting, educative and poignant; biblical truths about mercy, love, and forgiveness are explored and naturally woven into the day-to-day lives of the protagonists in a truthful and respectful manner reflecting the deep faith of the typical Nigerian. From the crippling infamous Lagos traffic, to the daily hustle that makes up life on the streets of Lagos and a visit to the local street food vendors (Bukkas) serving up the best in local delicacies, ""2 Weeks in Lagos will keep viewers glued to the screen from beginning to end.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQyMzYzMDctMTg2YS00N2IwLTlhN2MtNzFmNjdjYWYzYjE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjkyNTU3NTc@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg,imdb_dataset\Romance\189.jpg,Romance,0

In a world where no one is who they appear to be, Dhruva is an ordinary man who runs a chain of cyber cafés'. Or so it appears. What lies hidden about him is that he is an undercover agent working for the government in the anti-insurgency/terrorism prevention wing of RAW.

When CBI gets information that an unprecedented attack on the digital economy of the country is being planned by a group of hackers in an attempt to cripple the country's economy and take it, hostage, then to keep matters under wraps, the covert wing is activated. Aditya is one of the covert agents. During his investigation and attempts to sabotage the hacking plans, his opponents seem to be always outguessing his next move. To make matters worse, in the game of chess he is playing with an elderly gentleman (who claims to be a mere tailor), he is losing every single game. And the gentleman explains that perhaps he is able to read Aditya's mind and know his next move; which may be why Aditya is unable to defeat him.

How then, does our hero win the game of chess and out-wit the hackers? And how are these two tasks related? What big deception lies in store behind the game of the clash of minds and guts? And will he be able to protect his loved ones, the woman of his life and the apple of his eye, his eight-year-old niece? And who is this mysterious man who claims to be able to read minds?

Since they are diverse and untouched, they are oases of life containing preserved biotopes with rare and endangered species on the European level.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODU2YTE3ODctYWY0Ny00NjRhLTk1YTktNjE2M2U3MWQxNjM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUyNzU1NTE@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg,imdb_dataset\Adventure\142.jpg,Adventure,2

tt10871578,Il conte magico,"Directed by Marco Melluso, Diego Schiavo. With Roberta Giallo, Luciano Manzalini, Ivano Marescotti, Antonio Pisu. In a visual universe in which emerald nuances of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz blends with social networking graphics, four guys of ""Risorgimental Channel"" tells the life, success, adventures and misfortunes of a Bolognese man born in the early 1800's. A man who became Count and gained wealth and world fame by creating Electro-Homoeopathy. This is the story of Cesare Mattei. Cesare Mattei was born in Bologna in the early 1800s. A brilliant, generous and compassionate man that soon became a protagonist of his era. His life, marked by an endless love for his land and his people, as well as jealousies and hatred of his detractors, was shrouded in mystery until now. When in 1850 his mother got sick and died of cancer, Count Mattei decided to buy the land where the ruins of the ancient fortress of Savignano stood, to build his home there. To this day The Rocchetta he designed stands out in the landscape for its eclectic and composite style. The apparent stylistic chaos is in fact a rigorous and accurate design by the count, with carefully studied forms and proportions containing symbolic and astral references. Inside these rooms, during his solitary studies and experiments, Mattei conceived Electro-Homeopathy, a truly original procedure that united the nascent homeopathic practice with galvanic and Alchemy's notions. His remedies were immediately successful, increasingly so. The city of Bologna became a landmark and a destination of illustrious figures of the time, transforming itself into a sort of European and world attraction center. Mattei's remedies flourished from America to China and Electro-Homeopathy brought him incredible wealth and fame. Even the Devil, in Dostoevsky's novel ""Brothers Karamazov"", makes use of them. Just as in the story of ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"", withdrawal from the public sphere and the voluntary exile in a far and fabulous place, facilitate a shift in the perception of Cesare Mattei that sees him being catapulted from real man to fairy tale character. Everything about him seems to happen in another dimension. His own guests were subjected to a purification ritual before entering the Rocchetta. This legendary dimension, this mythical distance, bears a certain resemblance to what is happening today in social media networks. Having a virtual contact is like seeing someone at the window without being able to talk to him",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2U3YWEyYmQtMWM2MC00MTlhLThmZDAtMTgwMjE4YWEwZWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzQxODU1MjM@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg,imdb_dataset\Adventure\256.jpg,Adventure,2

tt0144449,Nema aviona za Zagreb,"Directed by Louis van Gasteren. With Meher Baba, Timothy Leary, Louis van Gasteren. It is 2012 and a very old Louis van Gasteren is reviewing an earlier phase in his life in a video editing suite. In the movie he is watching, a 42 year old Louis stands watching garbage cans loaded into a truck in 1964. The older Louis reflects upon his own image as a young man, ""At the age of 90, it's strange to look back at myself then. I see myself, knowing what has happened to me since, Yes, it's me but then again it isn't.""

We leave the old man and pick up the story as it unfolds beginning in 1964 in Amsterdam, when as a young man Louis began to film his feelings and experiences in a full length feature film. We see him and his family at a carnival, shot in gaudy color, a different time, before the 60s really happened, feeling almost like the 19th century. We hear a player piano. Louis is with his two young children from his first marriage, Louis and Dominique, and his second wife Jacqueline and their newly born daughter Mardou. They are watching a fat mother and daughter on a carnival stage, who together, we learn from a sign, weigh 900 pounds. The carnival barker explains that the fat women are very rare and gives their exact dimensions as they sit pleasantly in seats for the audience. The family then rides the carousel as Louis in voice over introduces each of them and himself to the viewer.

In voice over Louis explains that he is living the ""illusion"" of a lasting family life.

The film then regresses into Louis' past, as he explains through photos and archival footage that a few years earlier his parents had died, his mother three months after his father by taking her own life. His father had been a famous stage actor, Louis van Gasteren Sr., his mother a singer and communist who had quit the concert stage to travel through rural Spain, learning Spanish ballads from the peasants. Haunted by his mother's death, Louis plays for a colleague a recording he has of his mother singing in Spanish. He picks up a post card from her in Spain and explains she would describe not the temperature and food of a foreign country like most people, but the feel of a place like a hot Spanish harbor. Driving through the landscape of his childhood with his wife, he points out to her the sites he would visit as a boy when his family lived in the Hague, such as riding on the back of his father's bicycle and the things his father would observe. We see a shadow of a boy and a man on a bicycle seemingly following alongside Louis' and his wife's car as they drive down the country road. He says he thinks about his parents all the time.

The film ceases to look backward in time, and it comes to present day 1964 in a series of scenes in which Louis plays himself, along with actors, enacting a life of bourgeois meaninglessness. He plays himself as a man with no true interests besides indulging in pleasures. He catches the eye of an attractive woman in an airport in Zurich, and by editing alludes that he begins an affair with her. Cutting to his wife at home feeding their one year old child, we see that he has no spiritual direction or real scruples. Louis is then called to a meeting in a house in England, where a very respectable man who has brought along his elderly and apparently wealthy mother, informs him that he is the husband of the woman and that he has discovered the affair. Louis remains polite but quiet, obviously uncomfortable, as the man and his mother explain that they have called him to make him an offer of 5000 guineas to admit to having been with the man's wife, as the wife is ""quite mad"" and this will allow him to get a divorce. The husband explains to Louis that he will be 'helping them out' to admit to the affair, but Louis tensely folds his hands and forfeits the bribe, saying with mock dignity he cannot help them and is ""terribly sorry.""

Louis is now walking in Belgrade with a man much like himself. He explains that at a film festival in Yugoslavia he ran into an Italian journalist, Luigi de Santis, and the two began to hang out together, laughing off the language barrier since neither speak the native Serbian. On a whim they decide to book a plane to Zagreb, and go into a street side travel agency. The pretty blonde at the desk informs them in Serbian, ""Nama Aviona Za Zabreg."" The two laugh out loud, not having any idea what it means. The woman explains in English that it means, ""There is no plane for Zagreb, tomorrow."" The two leave without the tickets and go brawling in the bars, finding the incident inexplicably funny. Romping about drunk late into the night they keep repeating to locals, ""Nema Aviona Za Zagreb,"" the only phrase they know in Serbian.

But after parting from his friend Luigi, the phrase mysteriously lingers in Louis' mind and causes in him a kind of turning point in his otherwise aimless life and thoughts. He finds he cannot get the phrase ""Nema Aviona Za Zagreb"" out of his mind, as it falls off the tongue and has a quality to him, as if saying more than it appears to. He shortens the phrase to ""Nema"" (which in Serbian literally means ""there is no."")

""It became a catch-phrase that I summarized as the word Nema. Nema presupposes shared feelings and like-minded expectations. What Nema expresses is good will and a great incapacity. Nema and life as such cannot be tied down. You are in them, yet always off the mark.""

This begins an internal shift in his thinking, and from simply this phrase ""Nema Aviona Za Zagreb"" he develops an idea. He decides that he wants to film ""everything."" Excitedly explaining his film idea to his wife at home as she is cooking, and he is pacing their living room area, he says:

""I want to show everything, because every observation I make fits in with that. Look Jacq, every step I take also inwards everything I am involved in.""

From this point forward, he begins to question everything that he has ever heard, and to observe for himself and seek his own answers. He abandons his playboy existence. His interest has turned internal. Staring at himself in a distorting mirror right after the scene with his wife, he says in narration:

""I am of the opinion that life is one big illusion. I lost faith in the idea that parents and teachers are always right.""

Deciding that ""life is not what it seems,"" he begins a series of experiments to see if things he was taught or assumed all his life are true, and there is a series of scenes showing his search, initially using trivial and humorous examples the name of an insect he once saw which he is told ""does not exist,"" trying to fire a BB gun at a church bell he had always bragged he could get a C or a B-flat from, and tries and learns he cannot. He travels to Vancouver to visit an old middle school friend from the 30's and together they call one of their old school teachers to point out he was wrong about the pronunciation of the word ""Vancouver"" as ""Vancouver,"" and it all winds up a joke as Louis has set up a recording to say, ""It is Vancuvver, and will always be Vancuvver. You fail!""

He then begins to question what he really sees. Taking his son Louis on a ride through the countryside in the snow, he shares with his son how to observe life directly, and see what others do not.

As he and his son run through the snow, in voice over he narrates that about this time he decided to experiment with LSD. (At this time LSD was still legal and could be used therapeutically.)

In how many dimensions can someone see, think, and feel? In order to answer this question I started experimenting with LSD. I used LSD to investigate what the drug did to me and my surroundings. But I mainly wanted an answer to the question",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTMyMDVlOWUtOTA2My00MWJiLThhZmQtMjYxMWUzOGZmNDU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDQzMTY3OTA@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg,imdb_dataset\Biography\0.jpg,Biography,4

Howard was known for his right handed power back in his early day's so the day of the fateful accident was essentially the day Howard's boxing career came to an end.

A couple of days after the ""event"" a real Japanese turned up at the restaurant and demanded the same meal again. From this moment there was no way back. The Japanese loved Rolf Anschütz cooking and his restaurant ""Der Waffenschmied"" (Gunsmith) soon was honored as the place which offered the best and most authentic Japanese cuisine outside Japan. In the shortest time the Japanese have accepted Rolf Anschütz as one theirs. They celebrate the Authenzität of his kitchen and the ""original"" Japanese washing rituals before the meals would be served. First diplomats, later Japanese economic bosses and sports delegations were sitting in the pool of the now famous restaurant ""Waffenschmied - Japanese department"" - naked and side by side with government officials and the brigades of the East German working class. And because the omnipresent communist party cannot close the popular place any more, the state security better known as Stasi took also their seat in the pool. The party soon discovered Rolfs restaurant as a foreign currency bringer and allowed the import of Japanese food and exotic ingredients from a delicatessen importer from West Germany. And while Rolfs Anschütz, in the meantime, wearing kimonos and East German geisha's on his side, philosophies about the peaceful coexistence of the people in the World his restaurant turns into the only really existing ""theme park"" in East Germany.

tt0304681,The Secret Safari,Directed by Tom Zubrycki. A dramatized documentary showing how volunteers from England and Holland drove trucks full of hidden guns and ammunition overland across Africa to supply the African National Congress in their fight against the Apartheid government. Forty tons were transported under the seats of unsuspecting tourists on Africa Hinterland Expeditions between 1987 and 1993. No-one was ever caught and the mission remained one of the ANC's deepest secrets until 2001. The simple but ingenious technique of hiding the weapons was made more effective by the cover of the white tourists and the European drivers. In the 'Secret Safari' the filmmakers found the original tourists and reveal the most unusual holiday secret to very different responses.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmE1MDM5MDAtZTY4YS00NjE3LWFhOWUtY2QyMmFkYmU4NTRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTc1NzY1MTc@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg,imdb_dataset\Documentary\4.jpg,Documentary,7

tt0441506,Stolen Memories,"Directed by Kagan Goh. With Hadani Ditmars, Kagan Goh, Ron Korb, Mary Seki. IF YOU HAD TO WALK OUT OF YOUR PRESENT LIFE IN 48 HOURS, POSSIBLY NEVER TO RETURN, WHAT WOULD YOU TAKE WITH YOU? WHAT WOULD YOU LEAVE BEHIND?

STOLEN MEMORIES is a detective story about filmmaker Kagan Gohs personal quest to return a photo album stolen from a Japanese Canadian family during the Japanese internment.

The filmmakers brother bought a photo album along with a framed photograph of a Japanese samurai warrior that once belonged to a Japanese Canadian family, at a garage sale for a mere $5 apiece. When his brother asked the Caucasian man who sold him the album how he had come to possess such a precious family heirloom, he replied indifferently that he found it in the attic collecting dust and he just wanted to get rid of it. The photographs are dated 1939. Three years before the Japanese internment.

After the bombing of Pearl Harbour in 1942, Japanese Canadians were ordered to turn over property and belongings to the Custodian of Enemy Alien Property as a protective measure only. Caught in the whirlwind of anti-Japanese hysteria and paranoia, all of the Japanese descendents living in Canada at the time were rounded from their homes and herded off to internment camps and declared enemy aliens. They had no choice but to leave everything behind. The album was left behind when the family was interned and their possessions were either seized by the Canadian government and sold for a pittance, or stolen by looters. They lost everything.

Kagan Goh, aided by Mary Seki, his 70-year old detective sidekick, embarked upon a quest to find the rightful owners, find out what happened to them and return their lost photo album to them. Documenting the search as well as redressing the wrongs of the past is a symbolic homecoming coming home in terms of returning to a place of self-acceptance, belonging, wholeness and healing.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE2MDgxMDU1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjE2MzA1MDE@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg,imdb_dataset\Documentary\12.jpg,Documentary,7

After a long, treacherous journey stowed away in a dark hull of an overcrowded cargo ship, Yin Yin arrives in New York City for what she thinks will be the beginning of a better life. Falsely promised a job in the technology industry, her dreams are shattered when she is told by the Snakeheads, an Asian gang, that her debt is much higher than expected. To pay off that additional debt she will have to work it off by being a prostitute. Yin Yin is devastated by the news that she is being sold into the sex slave trade. The rundown, decrepit building that Yin Yin and the other prostitutes live and work in is known as the Shanghai Hotel. Women from Thailand, Korea and China all reside in the Shanghai Hotel. Some of the women know what they are there for but most are just like Yin Yin, unwilling participants forced to sell their bodies. Upon arriving at the Shanghai Hotel, Yin Yin is isolated and locked in a room all by herself. The room has many windows, but the glass is spray painted black so that no one can see in or out. One window though is missing and is covered with just black tape. Yin Yin lifts the tape and has her only view of freedom and the outside world, the streets of New York City. While staring out the window, Yin Yin notices a bike messenger who is giving some food and blankets to the homeless people across the street from the Shanghai Hotel. She can tell that he is a kind-hearted person and decides to try and communicate with him. She gets his attention and passes him a note. The note tells of her horrible situation, but pleads with him not to tell anyone for fear of what repercussions the Snakeheads might take on her family in China. She ends the note by saying all she really needs is a friend. The bike messenger, named Carlos (Hill Harper), accepts her invitation of friendship but over time a love between the two of them develops through the passing of notes.

tt10080062,Bernard,"Directed by Álex Quiroga. With Sarah Alexander, Jorge Bosso, María Cristina Barbabosa Meek, Jean Yves Morel. BERNARD a movie by Alex Quiroga

Hernán and Marie Christine are two brothers who live in Pátzcuaro, Michoacán. Hernán is an architect, Christine is a health therapist. One day they receive a call informing them that their father who lives in France is terminally ill with Alzheimer's disease. They have to decide whether to go see him or not because he left his mother long ago and they have not heard from him for years. They must make a decision and soon. Lives are very personal issues, one can say that isolated, if you think of an initial instance, within what we understand as the development of individual consciousness but, when expressing them in a global vision, by communicating those individualities, by making those silent reflective acts, where consciousness seems to be shared, or parts of a fragmented reality, it is in these fractions of visions that we have of reality, and that by uniting them they show us a much bigger picture, than at first we could have obtained, it is a space of more formative understanding in terms of the levels of spiritual and logical issues. It is in the union of all the individual visions, that when sharing them, they group and conglomerate that space where a greater explanation can still be found, a group unit of this act that has the search for the meaning of life, while we are and , in which we are given this ability to understand the meaning of a humanity that awakens the experience that we understand as life. And as a whole humanity, we stop to perceive in a different way what experience is, as individuals and beings that reproduce continuously and, experience has no time, has no space; It is our bodies that confine themselves to these reductions, where consciousness, outside of any physical question, is sought after visualization, perhaps reaching to understand 'the moment' in which the understanding of 'I UNDERSTAND' is produced that moment, that precise moment in which the conscience appears to us as a clearer situation, and which, for some reason, we say to ourselves' it is true 'It is there, that spirituality marks the limits, there is an inside and there is an outside, and they interpose to generate that our act of conscience, which remains a mystery.

tt11382860,Of Rails & Sails,"Directed by Joseph E Daniel. With Johnny Day, Jim Horning. Of Rails & Sails is a one-hour docudrama about the extraordinary life and times of Arthur Curtis James, a relatively unknown railroad baron, prominent and intrepid yachtsman, generous philanthropist, avant garde socialite and secret philanderer, who was one of the ten richest men in America in the 1920s and 30s, owning one-seventh of all the railroad track in the United States. Unlike his contemporaries - Vanderbilt, Morgan, Rockefeller - Arthur Curtiss James is not a household name. Arthur was a private man who did business quietly, efficiently, and smartly. His far-reaching, enormous philanthropic activities were done without fanfare, often anonymously. Yet he is an exemplar of privileged life during the Golden Age. He was the last great railroad developer, building the final and most complete transcontinental railroad system in America. He was also an extraordinary yachtsman who owned and sailed three of the great, legendary yachts of the time - over a quarter of a million lifetime nautical miles!

His main residence was Beacon Hill House, a 33-acre estate in Newport, Rhode Island, but he owned expansive mansions in Manhattan and Tarrytown, New York, and in Coconut Grove, Florida. By all accounts he was a likable, reasonable gentleman of good humor. He was a patron of art and culture, and a generous benefactor to those in need. He was adventurous and fun loving - perhaps a little too fun loving, as whispered rumors of his infidelity and womanizing were not uncommon amongst the employees living on his estate. One such insinuation cost a close relative her inheritance. Drawing on the remarkable likeness of actor James Horning as Arthur, and Johnny Day as his friend Peter (and the film's narrator), Of Rails & Sails tells the story of this remarkable man, who died in 1941 but whose footprint still looms large today.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmUxMWNkMmUtMWJlZS00YjBmLWJmMmUtMGMwMjhhN2M3MjZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI4MjIwNDk@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg,imdb_dataset\History\178.jpg,History,12

tt11740458,Genesis with Max McLean,"Directed by Jonathan Wilson. With Max McLean. ""Genesis"" is the story of stories, an eloquent retelling of the first book of the Bible and a theatrical tour de force. With remarkable energy and a gift for storytelling that can prickle the back of your neck, McLean captures the humor and pathos in Genesis' dramatic sweep from Eden to Babel, from the immense flood of Noah to Abraham's heart-cleaving sacrifice of his son Isaac, from the epic destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah to Jacob's soul-wounding wrestling match with the Angel of God.

This is a remarkable and unforgettable one-man theatrical account of the Bible's book of Genesis. It is retold by dramatic speaker and awesome storyteller Max McLean. The event took place at Truman College in Chicago, Illinois, with background sounds and lighting emphasizing the stories told from Genesis.

From creation to the Garden of Eden and Noah building the Ark, you will be enthralled by McLean's retelling. He moves on to the stories of Lot, Ishmael and Isaac, and Jacob and Esau. He also clearly tells the story of Abraham. He will keep your attention through story after story, which are divided into six sessions. Taken from the NIV version of the Bible, McLean brings the book of Genesis to life on the stage with this dramatic presentation, which earns the Dove ""Faith-Friendly"" Seal of approval for ages 12 and up.

tt10196086,Contradict,"Directed by Thomas Burkhalter, Peter Guyer. With Adomaa, Akan, Mutombo da Poet, Mensa. When two friends collect money for the so-called ""suffering in America"" in the streets of Accra, is it for fun, political provocation, or a prophecy? Two Swiss filmmakers will answer these questions with the help of seven musicians from Ghana-M3NSA, Wanlov The Kubolor, Adomaa, Worlasi, Akan, Mutombo Da Poet, and Poetra Asantewa-who have written new songs and produced video clips especially for the documentary film Contradict.

Tomorrow's ideas and trends are emerging more decentralized than ever in a globalized world. What do global developments and shifts in values look like from the ground up in Ghana and the African continent? How do we want to confront and contradict those changes? Can new visions for the future become global realities?

Contradict shows this new generation of musicians taking on the post-colonial struggles of their parents and grandparents with new means and allies. They produce their work cheaply thanks to new software, and they spread their concerns rapidly over the Internet. In their music, they demand a new role for Africa in today's world, strengthen women's self-confidence, combat environmental pollution, and teach their peers self-acceptance, self-confidence, and self-esteem. They reflect on alternative lifestyles and new career paths and contradict the mainstream views of neighbors, ministers, and the omnipresent priests in the numerous mega churches in their country.

In the collaboration with these Ghanaian artists, it becomes clear that anyone who wants to change something is walking a fine line between creativity, anger, exhaustion, and depression. Contradict thus becomes an urgent, fragile, and at times humorous appeal for change.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2ZhZTg0YTQtMDg3ZC00ZmViLTlkZmUtMTlhNzJmY2I2NjM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAxNzkyODE4._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg,imdb_dataset\Music\18.jpg,Music,14

tt11146760,Panghrun,"Directed by Mahesh Manjrekar. With Amol Bawdekar, Gauri Ingavale, Vidyadhar Joshi, Deepti Lele. India gained independence in 1947, but for the womenfolk, freedom was still a distant dream. It took a long period of struggle for the society to accept remarriage of widows or prevent underage girls from getting married in the first place. Pleas of women to lead a normal life had no place in a male-dominated society. Women were forced to abide by their traditional role, keeping forever mum, without being able to express their feelings, urges, or love. PANGHRUN is a love story that takes place in this dark age when women could do no more than honor their family name, fall in love with a person chosen for them by someone else, and remain faithful to him at any cost. Inspired by a short story by the renowned poet and author B B Borkar, and directed by Mahesh Manjrekar, PANGHRUN is a tragic tale of love, compassion and ultimate sacrifice one will make, to have a shot at redemption.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VkMjQ0YjYtNWU3My00YmEwLWE5OTItMmYwMmNkNWQyZjk3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzQ5Njc3NzU@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg,imdb_dataset\Musical\65.jpg,Musical,16

At one point, Devaduta starts hearing a voice that she identifies as the 'Voice of God'. She escapes from her home, to find employment as a cleaner at a dance academy. The guru at this academy identifies a spark in her and trains her, to see her blossom into a danseuse par excellence. With her fame and fortunes, Devaduta goes on to build an Ashram to help needy children, while being constantly guided by the 'Voice of God'. Her social work and the fact that she hears 'the Voice of God' gets her the epithet of 'The Prophet' from the people. However one day the voice tells her she has a year to live, and this realization completely shatters the equanimity of Devaduta. The story goes on to explore the relevance of a Prophet in a world deemed to be created without hierarchies by God.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2ZDI2ZjYtMmRhMy00NmMwLWEwNDUtNGQ4N2EzMmI2ZmM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA5NzEwOTAx._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg,imdb_dataset\Musical\78.jpg,Musical,16

tt11584906,The Broken String,"Directed by Francesco Leprino. With Claudio Astronio, Paolo Cosenza, Sonia Grandis, Serena Erba. The film about Alessandro Stradella, one of the greatest composers of the Baroque period, is based on the music filmed and recorded during the Festival of the Ancient Music Academy of Milan in 2017, as well as the music recorded in July 2018 in Milan by the Ensemble Claudio Astronio, one of the greatest interpreters of Stradella's music. The fictional parts, which stem directly from the music, focus on Alessandro Stradella'dangerous relationships with females, who impacted on his artistic and personal life and caused his premature and tragic death (he was stabbed to death at age 38, a rarity in the history of music).

tt11620786,Heroes,"Directed by Manish Pandey. With Mika Häkkinen, Tom Kristensen, Felipe Massa, Michèle Mouton. A new feature-length film focusing on the lives of five motor racing legends will be unveiled this July, in the week leading up to the British Grand Prix. The film, Heroes, has been written and directed by Manish Pandey, who ten years ago wrote the screenplay for the award-winning Senna.

This new movie - commissioned by the Motorsport Network - brings together drivers from F1, sportscars and rallying who tell their stories to each other over an evening in an English stately home.

tt1258812,War of the Gods,"Directed by Jennifer Abbott. With Ahmed Al Dubayan, Yasser Arafat, David Ben-Gurion, Tony Blair. This documentary aims to prove to the world that religion has become the weapon used both by the devout, and political leaders, to win their wars. Jennifer Abbott's ambition is to show the world that true religion is not what our leaders use to create hostilities against other countries. This is why religion appears to be at the root of so many problems today. Is the warfare and corruption perpetrated by those leaders who claim to serve God, justified? She wonders what God they worship. It's certainly not the same God she knows. The fault lies not with all religion and religious leaders, but with false doctrine and false beliefs passed on to the people through unfair media, schools, and parental influence. What does God represent, and do we follow his words. The Bible teaches and plainly states,

Of course, this made me wonder why would a man who has had this joie de vivre return to the places that were remote. He indicated that his solitude was what allowed him to see nature's subtle play on colours. Brush stroke after brush stroke of laying colours until it took hues of golden rays caress on an autumn day made all the more sense. This was Peter's vision which he took as souvenirs from these lands and transplanted them in his studio. His diligent appliance of colours created a harmony in his paintings that is perhaps lost on today's art scene. Louder, bolder, more shocking seems to be the theme of the day.
